# Gentmini

A minimal AI Agent using Gemini. Built from scratch in Python.

## Learning Goals

The learning goals of this project are:

1. Introduce us to multi-directory Python projects
2. Understand how the AI tools that we'll almost certainly use on the job actually work under the hood
3. Practice our Python and functional programming skills

The goal is not to build an LLM from scratch, but to instead use a pre-trained LLM to build an agent from scratch.
